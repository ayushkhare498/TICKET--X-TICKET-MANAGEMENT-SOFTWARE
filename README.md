# TICKET--X-TICKET-MANAGEMENT-SOFTWARE
With this project, the administrator can observe how many people visit the facility and how many tickets are generated over a given time period. This Ticket-X successfully administers and controls all aspects of a facility's operation. The software system may store the information from customers who purchased tickets to visit the place. The technology also keeps track of and determines ticket prices. The system requires an administrator to enter ticket details such as how many adults and children are on the ticket, print the ticket, and hand it over to the appropriate individual.
